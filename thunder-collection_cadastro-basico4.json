R.

His mother's family had once been wealthy, owning a successful construction business, but lost it all in the Great Depression, something Martin was reminded about every day when he passed what used to be his family's dock and house. It made him feel that even if they were poor, they came from greatness that had been taken away from them.[9] He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Janet. His mother was of half Irish ancestry.[10] He also acknowledges French, English, Welsh and German roots,[11] which were confirmed on the television series Finding Your Roots. However, while he also believed he was a quarter Italian because of who he was told was his paternal grandfather, a DNA test on the show confirmed his Irish and other ancestries but excluded any Italian ancestry, showing instead he is approximately a quarter Ashkenazi Jewish.[12] The family first lived in a house on Broadway belonging to Martin's great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks.[10] During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of First Street to Fifth Street, between his grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.[13] Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in sinister plots.[14] Martin had a habit of starting endless stories that he never completed, as they did not turn out as well on paper as he had imagined them.[15] Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later Marist High School. While there he became an avid comic book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by Marvel Comics,[16] and later credited Stan Lee for being one of his greatest literary influences; Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien.[17] A letter Martin wrote to the editor of Fantastic Four was printed in issue No. 20 (November 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., Fantastic Four #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines;[18] he bought the first ticket to the world's first Comic-Con, held in New York in 1964.[19][20] In 1965, Martin won comic fandom's Alley Award for Best Fan Fiction for his prose superhero story Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier.[21]\",\n    \"cpf\": \"551.069.280-44\"\n}","form":[]},"tests":[]},{"containerId":"","sortNum":105000,"headers":[{"name":"Accept","value":"*/*"},{"name":"User-Agent","value":"Thunder Client (https://www.thunderclient.com)"}],"colId":"88dd487d-4878-4258-98cd-33eb26c284b7","name":"Create Autor (Blank CPF)","url":"http://localhost:8080/autores","method":"POST","modified":"2022-03-29T16:35:16.334Z","created":"2022-03-29T16:19:38.060Z","_id":"85b31cb8-83bc-4a35-aa91-4aa86629a97c","params":[],"body":{"type":"json","raw":"{\n    \"nome\": \"Thiago R.
